# Minimalistic Swift AppKit Project

This project is an update and an adaptation of an original project shown
on the [PracticalSwift.com][original] blog, and lately also updated by
[Arcane Science Lab][arcane]. It includes a `Makefile` published by
[David Owens II][makefile] to compile the application on the command
line.

## Requirements

This code has been updated and tested with Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2.

## Usage

1. Launch `make` on the command line to build the application. The
   result of the compilation is in the `build` folder.
2. Alternatively, use the `run.sh` script, or directly run
   `./browser.swift` in the `src` directory; both commands will launch
   the application directly.
